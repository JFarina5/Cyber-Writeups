# Natas

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to provide information and writeups of wargames provided [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) under the [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) wargame.

## Description
> Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

> Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

> Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.

>Start here:

> - Username: natas0
> - Password: natas0
> - URL: http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
